- [x] Verify that the copilot-instructions.md file exists in `.github/`.
- [x] Clarify project requirements (Node.js + Express backend, React frontend, WebSockets, matching engine, Kafka/Redis integrations).
- [x] Scaffold the project (npm workspace with shared/server/web packages, base tsconfig, tooling).
- [x] Customise the project (matching engine, REST/WebSocket APIs, React dashboard, shared types, styling).
- [x] Install required extensions (none needed).
- [x] Compile the project (install dependencies, run builds/tests for shared, server, and web workspaces).
- [x] Create and run task ("Run Dev Servers" task launches the stack).
- [ ] Launch the project (await user confirmation to start a debug/run session).
- [x] Ensure documentation is complete (README and this file should reflect the current project state).

Guidelines:
- Work through the checklist sequentially and keep progress up to date.
- Keep explanations concise and focused on user requests.
- Use the repository root as the working directory unless instructed otherwise.
- Prefer concrete code/configuration changes over high-level suggestions when feasible.
- Avoid installing VS Code extensions unless explicitly requested.
